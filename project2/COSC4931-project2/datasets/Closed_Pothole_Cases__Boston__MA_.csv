1.01001E+11,3/13/14 0:00,4/4/14 0:00,Closed,Case Closed Case Resolved The PWD inspected the intersection of Beacon St and Mass Av this week.    The paving engineers had already determined the intersection  along with the adjacent segments of Mass Av and Beacon St  needed to be resurfaced.    The City requires that all proposed paving segments be reviewed by utility companies  fellow City departments and other agencies to determine if they have future planned work within the same limits of construction prior to our paving operations.    We did find some conflicting planned utility work.    The City is currently coordinating those projects and the hope is that we can pave later in the year.    In the meantime  we have asked our maintenance contractor to perform interim roadway repairs.    This will including some permanent utility patching  and milling off and paving small areas of broken pavement. We will also request that utility companies raise of their sunken castings.    The area in your picture will be included in the interim repairs.    This work should take place starting in the next few weeks. I believe it will improve the current condition of the roadway.    Our District Yard  as always  will periodically inspect the location and patch potholes when needed.    I would like to speak with you personally  and if you could call or email me back I?d appreciate it.
